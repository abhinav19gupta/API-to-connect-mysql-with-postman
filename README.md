# API-to-connect-mysql-with-postman 
Hi all, I've created this API to connect to a MySQL database. I'm using the MySQL connector for this purpose. You can interact with the database using the Postman app to update, delete, or modify any data.

I've designed this API primarily for database testing. It includes a table named "emp" with columns "id," "name," "email," "phone," and "address."

Please save this file as a Python file and use any IDE tool such as Spyder, PyCharm, or Visual Studio. Then, in the terminal, run the following command:
python filename.py 

This command will start a local server. Use the provided server address in the Postman app for interacting with the database.
